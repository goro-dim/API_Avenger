# API Avenger

Welcome to **API Avenger** – your first line of defense and offense in the epic battle for secure APIs! This project is a work in progress aimed at building a powerful AI-powered tool to test, defend, and optimize the security of your APIs.

## Project Overview

API Avenger is designed to leverage cutting-edge AI technology to simulate both offensive and defensive security strategies. With this tool, you can:

- Test APIs for common vulnerabilities (e.g., brute-force attacks, token theft, SQL injection).
- Implement defensive mechanisms that learn from attacks and adapt in real-time.
- Generate realistic traffic logs for training and improving AI models.

This project is still evolving, so stay tuned as we add more features, improve security models, and refine attack simulations. We’re building a solution that could be your **"shield" against API vulnerabilities**. After all, as Tony Stark said:

> “Sometimes you gotta run before you can walk.”

## Current Status

**Work in progress** – This project is in active development, with several key features already implemented, including:

- **API Mock Server**: A simple Flask-based server that simulates endpoints for testing.
- **Offensive Scripts**: Python scripts that simulate common API attacks (e.g., brute-force, token theft).
- **Defensive Logging**: Logs that track and report request data for AI training and analysis.
- **Configurable Secret Key**: A `key_setup.py` script to generate and store a secure secret key for JWT signing.


## How to Use

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/goro-dim/API_Avenger.git
    cd API_Avenger
    ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. **Generate the secret key** (optional, but recommended):
    Run `key_setup.py` to create a configuration file for the secret key.
    ```bash
    python API_Avenger/api/key_setup.py
    ```
    This script will generate a `config.py` file containing the secret key. Make sure this file is added to your `.gitignore` to avoid exposing your key in version control.

4. **Run the API server**:
    ```bash
    python API_Avenger/mock_api.py
    ```

5. **Execute the offensive scripts**:
    ```bash
    python API_Avenger/offensive_scripts/brute_force/brute_force.py -u usernames.txt -p passwords.txt
    ```

*Remember*: This is a powerful tool. Use it responsibly and only in environments where you have permission to test!

## Features to Come

- Advanced **AI models** for automated attack detection and response.
- **Real-time defenses** that adapt to new attack vectors.
- Enhanced **simulation** scripts with customizable payloads and attack patterns.
- **Integration with other tools** for continuous security monitoring.

## Security Best Practices

- **Store secrets securely**: Ensure your `SECRET_KEY` is stored securely and not hard-coded in production code. Use environment variables or secure secret management services.
- **Use HTTPS**: Always use HTTPS in a production environment to encrypt communications and prevent token interception.

## Project Motivation

As the saying goes:

> “With great power, comes great responsibility.”

We’re building **API Avenger** to ensure that APIs stay secure and resilient against ever-evolving threats. So, if you’re tired of vulnerabilities running rampant like Loki with his scepter, **join us in this quest**!

> “I am Iron Man.” – And we are all in this together to protect our digital world.



## Disclaimer

**API Avenger** is a tool intended for educational and research purposes only. Always use it in controlled environments where you have authorization to test security.
